And this is were functions come into play. They allow you to recycle code you have already written. You might not have noticed it, but you have already used funcions. For example math.sqrt() is a function. A simple example for a function would be:"

    "## Catching Errors in Python (Making Exceptions)\n",
    "Usually errors occur in Python when you did something wrong and this is how it is supposed to be. But problems can arise when you did nothing wrong and your program terminates. A common example is user input. Think back to the program we used yesterday were you asked the user for the price of the vacation and so forth. You just assumed that a sane person would enter a number if asked for a price, but they could easily typed in a string. Now you have a problem, as you told the program to convert the user input to a number, but you cannot convert a word to a number in a meaningful way. And this is were error catching comes into play. \n",

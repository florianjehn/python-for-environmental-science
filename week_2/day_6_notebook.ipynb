    "When using all those different ways to access parts of dataframes confusion can arise, as some methods create copies (you get a new dataframe) and some other create a view (you still work with the old dataframe, but only see a part of it). However [general rules](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23296282/what-rules-does-pandas-use-to-generate-a-view-vs-a-copy) exist. For convenience I made a 'copy':\n",

    "## Grouping Dataframes\n",
    "Looking at data often requires you to make a selection, as you only want to look at certain cases and not the whole dataset. For example in the energy dataset we used it might be interesting to look at the data grouped by continent. Pandas provides a very useful tool for this: groupby(). Take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/Wb2Tp35dZ-I) to get an introduction. As the dataframes we have used so far do not have any categories to group them by we will take a look at [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). (You will have to create a Kaggle account to download it, if you do not want to use your own mail adress for this, try [this](https://www.10minutemail.com) disposable one). Now, lets read it in."
